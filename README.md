### Flow

1. Landing Page: 
   Comes up only if you are not logged in
   
   From here the user can proceed as a vendor or as a customer


2. Login/Registration and OTP Page

   As we have only a concept of phone number for your login, the user will enter their user number and have to validate using OTP.
   Once validated the account is created if noe exists for that phone number or data is retrieved if the user already exists

If you are a first time guest user you come into the flow of adding a new event. If you are a returning guest user then you go the events dashboard

3. Add new event 
 Basic information on adding an event, which then leads to the event details screen from where the user can do other things
